String SongLyrics = """[00:25.59]Words like violence
[00:27.79]Break the silence
[00:29.54]Come crashing in
[00:31.79]Into my little world
[00:33.54]Painful to me
[00:35.79]Pierce right through me
[00:37.79]Can't you understand
[00:40.04]Oh my little girl
[00:42.54]All I ever wanted
[00:44.29]All I ever needed
[00:46.29]Is here in my arms
[00:49.59]Words are very unnecessary
[00:54.59]They can only do harm
[01:22.79]Vows are spoken
[01:24.79]To be broken
[01:26.79]Feelings are intense
[01:29.04]Words are trivial
[01:31.79]Pleasures remain
[01:33.79]So does the pain
[01:35.79]Words are meaningless
[01:37.79]And forgettable
[01:40.04]All I ever wanted
[01:42.29]All I ever needed
[01:43.79]Is here in my arms
[01:47.29]Words are very unnecessary
[01:51.79]They can only do harm
[02:33.04]All I ever wanted
[02:34.79]All I ever needed
[02:37.04]Is here in my arms
[02:40.54]Words are very unnecessary
[02:45.29]They can only do harm
[02:50.79]All I ever wanted
[02:52.29]All I ever needed
[02:54.04]Is here in my arms
[02:58.04]Words are very unnecessary
[03:02.29]They can only do harm
[04:08.54]Enjoy the silence
